Documentation
=============

RESTful server
--------------
Here you can find help on how to [install and configure](install.md) the FTS3 RESTful interface.

RESTful API
-----------
You can check the automatically [generated documentation](api.md) in this same folder.

Or you can have a look at our examples [using directly curl](api-curl.md)

We also provide some Python wrappers to facilitate the usage of the REST API. They are called [easy bindings](easy/README.md).

For [developers only](developers.md)

Command Line Interface
----------------------
We provide a collection of [command line tools](cli.md) as a reference implementation, but they are also
fully functional.

Troubleshooting
---------------
If you are having trouble installing, configuring or using the REST API, check the [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) documentation, in case it has been already covered.
If it isn't there, please, contact us at <fts-support@cern.ch>
